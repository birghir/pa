# Pi√±ol's Adventure: Concept
You start the game as Pepo. The intro begins with Pepo having a nightmare (nightmares are repeated thruoghout the game). Pepo eventually cracks the meaning of these nightmares, as he ends up with a number: 187. The exact number of employees in the company.
The mission is to obliberate them all.

There are things that you must keep in check:
- Hydration
- Energy
- Hunger
- Physicall fitness
- Paranoia
- Entertainment

Alcohol, cigarettes and such will reduce your health.

You can make choices; to work normally, hard, or to take it easy. The first option will consume more energy, but you will have a greater chance at getting promoted in the company. The rest is self explanatory.

You can spend time to study, to improve your chances of promotion, or to buy things from the narco that lives next to Pepo - to use the products against the company. You create a plan to obliterate everybody there. Poison, explosives, spikes, etc.

Getting to be CEO, CTO, CSO, etc. gives you achievements and more money to buy more expensive things. Should you be a CEO, you can turn the company into anything - selling weapons, drugs, etc. Kill the investors.
