# Pi√±ol's Adventure: Concept
You start the game as Pepo. The intro begins with Pepo having a nightmare (nightmares are repeated thruoghout the game). Pepo eventually cracks the meaning of these nightmares, as he ends up with a number: 187. The exact number of employees in the company.
The mission is to obliberate them all.

There are things that you must keep in check:
- Hydration
- Energy
- Hunger
- Physicall fitness
- Paranoia
- Entertainment
